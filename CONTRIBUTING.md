# Contributing to TEAPOT

Thank you for your interest in the TEAPOT project!

## Current Status

This repository contains **validation methodology and academic documentation** for a patent-pending tensor operator. The core operator coefficients are proprietary and not open for modification at this time.

## How You Can Contribute

### 📊 Validation & Testing
- **Independent Verification**: Run the validation framework on PhysioNet data and report your findings
- **Cross-Dataset Testing**: Test on additional EEG datasets (MIMIC-III, SHHS, etc.)
- **Bug Reports**: If you find issues with the validation code, please [open an issue](https://github.com/mirpanda1118/TEAPOT/issues)

### 📝 Documentation
- **Tutorial Improvements**: Suggest clearer explanations or examples
- **Translation**: Help translate documentation to other languages
- **Use Case Examples**: Share how you're using the validation framework

### 💡 Feature Requests

We welcome suggestions for:
- Additional validation metrics
- Visualization improvements
- Integration with other EEG analysis tools
- Consumer device compatibility testing

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/mirpanda1118/TEAPOT/issues) with the "enhancement" label.

## What We're NOT Accepting

❌ **Pull requests modifying core operator coefficients** (these are patent-protected)  
❌ **Requests to open-source the proprietary algorithm**  
❌ **Alternative implementations claiming equivalent performance**
